South West Eco Discoveries are a new Eco Tour business based in Dunsborough. The brief was to create a clean, modern and user friendly website with the coastal vibe that reflects the South West region. 

A logo was crafted, with grounded sensibilities - earth tones, bold typography and a touch of excitement.

The site is responsive and uses Wordpress CMS, allowing easy content management.
